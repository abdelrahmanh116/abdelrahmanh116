## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**abdelrahmanh116/abdelrahmanh116** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on channeling my experience into a new direction â€” diving deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence. Whether through hands-on learning, certifications, or exploring AIâ€™s impact on productivity and business innovation, Iâ€™m passionate about evolving with the tech landscape and helping others do the same.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI-powered productivity tools, agentic workflows, or practical projects that explore the real-world value of LLMs. Iâ€™m especially interested in initiatives that bridge business strategy with AI executionâ€”where I can contribute with my background in data protection, support operations, and team coordination.
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with refining my skills in AI product development and real-world deployment of LLM agents. I'm currently exploring use cases and would love guidance from experienced AI developers or mentors on building robust, useful tools.
